Q8. Async and Defer
A8. Normally html parsing is paused when it encounters a script tag and continues only after it completes script fetching and execution.
    Async - Html parsing is paused only for executng the script, it fetches the script in parallel with html parsing.
    Defer - Html parsing is not paused, rather the script is fetched in parallel and executed only after parsing is complete.

    Note: Async doesnt guarantee ordeer in which the scripts would be executed in case of multiple scripts.
